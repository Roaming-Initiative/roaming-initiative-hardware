# Contrib

The Contrib folder is a place for all outside contributions that are licensed 
under a free license that requires attribution or has other clauses. There are
many good reasons for choosing other licenses for your work, and the license 
this repository is under may be too restrictive for the original author, so 
there exists contrib where relevant content can be added without concern about 
bringing in content with varying licenses.


## Licensing

Non-CC-BY free content licenses are fine, files which are licensed under
different licenses should have an additional file created in the same directory
with the name of the file followed by .LICENSE.txt with it's license so that 
the license the file is under is clear, for example: randpic.png.LICENSE.txt is
in the same directory as randpic.png. For folders, please include a LICENSE.md file in the main folder 
for that content, and for variances from that license for files in that folder
include <filename>.LICENSE.md
